//2. let variable = the new value.
//3. let old variable = new varaible.
//4. Assigning a varible means giving a variable a value. Declaring a variable is stating that the variable will be used in the code
//   but does not need a value assigned at that point.  Define
//5. Pseudocoding is writing out what you want the code to do in plain English as a way to
//   get a handle on where you want the code to go without getting bogged down in technicalities to start.
//6. Planning should be about 75-90% of the time spent and typing the code
//   should be about 10-25%.

// B. Strings
// 1.
/*
let firstVariable = "Hello World";
firstVariable = 25;
let secondVariable = firstVariable;
secondVariable = "this";

// 2.

let yourName = "James";
console.log("Hello, my name is " + yourName);
*/

// C. Booleans

const a = 4;
const b = 53;
const c = 57;
const d = 16;
const e = 'Kevin';

console.log(a < b);
console.log(c > d);
console.log('Name' == 'Name');
console.log(true != false);
console.log(false == false == false == false == false == false == true);
console.log(false == false)
console.log(e == 'Kevin');
console.log(a && b < c);
console.log(a == a != d);
console.log(48 == '48');
